# Challenge 19 - TextEditor

## Decription: 

* As a developer, I wanted to create a functional web text editor, so that the user can modify code.

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a text editor web application
WHEN I open my application in my editor
THEN I should see a client server folder structure
WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory
THEN I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client
WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal
THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack
WHEN I run my webpack plugins
THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application
THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors
WHEN I open the text editor
THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it
THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB
WHEN I click on the Install button
THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop
WHEN I load my web application
THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox
WHEN I register a service worker
THEN I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets
WHEN I deploy to Heroku
THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application
```

## Usage:

* This web application should be used to create, modify, and delete text in a text editor.

* Link to GitHub repository: https://github.com/CandaceG00/textEditor


## Screenshots:

* Unavailable. Although I was able to get the server end to work, I was not able to deploy the web application or get it to populate. It was throwing errors and I was not able to display the icon. Webpack did not allow me to build. I had two weeks of tutoring but was not able to resolve the issue.
